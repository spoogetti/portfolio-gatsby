This is my personal blog template. It'll act as a diary to keep memory of most of the things I do. 
Everything will be written in an approximate english as it is not my native language.<br>  
The base template is taken from
[Developer Diary by willjw3](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/willjw3/gatsby-starter-developer-diary).<br>  

Note: This post is tagged with every possible tags to display them in the sidebar.
