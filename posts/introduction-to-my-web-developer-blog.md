This is my personal blog template. It'll act as a diary to keep memory of most of the things I do. 
I won't self-promote until I feel like what I have to say deserve to be known to the world (most likely never ever).
Everything will be written in an approximate english as it is not my native language.<br>  
The base template was taken from
[Developer Diary by willjw3](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/willjw3/gatsby-starter-developer-diary).<br>  

Note: This post is tagged with every possible tags to display them in the sidebar.
