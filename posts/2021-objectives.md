This small post will sum up some of my objectives for 2021, 
we'll see if all of them are completed next year for the 2022 objective list !

First, I have to keep in mind that 2021 will be another rough year, with the pandemic still lurking behind our backs, 
I consider myself on the good side of the pandemic, but the social impact is still pretty hard.

"2021", It feels like we're in the future, let's act like it.

I want / need to further sharpen my skills if I want to achieve peace of mind and efficiency in my work. 
To do so, I'm going to :
- At least solve the first 100 problems of the Euler project.
- Reach a comfortable typing speed of 80 WPM (I'm at around 60 ATM, up from 35 when I started)
- Begin heavily testing the code I produce.
- Begin heavy usage of design patterns and gain expertise in my favorite frameworks.
  
I feel like my current company is exactly giving me the opportunity to achieve this.

In my hobbies I want to produce at least 1 game a month with the Godot engine, 
I don't really care if the product isn't polished, 
I just want to practice game making and game mechanics as I consider it the ultimate form of development, 
the hardest and last frontier. 

As a sport objective I hope to be capable of running 10 km under 50 min 
(this one is ambitious I'm still only capable of around 8,5 km an hour, cardio training is hard)

A good objective that I give myself every year is to read at least 5 books.

These objectives are not exactly for 2021, heck I even released this post in middle february... 
I began before the new year and plan on continuing if I don't complete them, 
they are long termed objectives without formal start nor formal end.
I have for philosophy that if I can't start and keep at it on a "normal" day, they won't hold very well with time.
